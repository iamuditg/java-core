Method Overloading in Calculator

Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name but with different parameter lists. The compiler determines which method to invoke based on the number and types of arguments provided during the method call.

In this example, we have a Calculator class with four overloaded methods for addition:

Method 1: add(int a, int b)
This method takes two integer arguments and returns their sum as an integer.

Method 2: add(double a, double b)
This method takes two double arguments and returns their sum as a double.

Method 3: add(int a, int b, int c)
This method takes three integer arguments and returns their sum as an integer.

Method 4: add(double a, double b, double c)
This method takes three double arguments and returns their sum as a double.

The CalculatorApp Class
The CalculatorApp class contains the main() method, where we create an instance of the Calculator class. We then call each overloaded add method with different arguments and store the results in different variables.

During compilation, the Java compiler determines which version of the add method to call based on the number and types of arguments provided in each method call.

Method overloading provides code simplicity and flexibility by allowing us to use the same method name for different versions of a method with similar functionality but different argument types or numbers. This makes the code more readable and reduces the need for multiple method names, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
